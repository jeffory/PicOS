// App stack: run an app runtime on its own Process Stack (PSP)
//
// Core 0's main stack (MSP) is only 4 KB (SCRATCH_Y) and also takes every
// interrupt. Both app runtimes therefore run in Thread mode on the PSP, on a
// stack the runner allocates at launch:
//   - native ELF apps (native_loader.c): the app's entry point
//   - Lua apps (lua_runner.c): the whole VM lifetime (state creation, load,
//     run, error screen, lua_close and its __gc handlers)
//   - OS work from the launcher (app_stack_run_os): dev commands and
//     screenshot save, on a short-lived 32 KB stack
// Only one runner is active at a time, and app_stack_run_os() runs inline
// when an app stack is already active, so one PSP user exists at a time.
// Interrupt handlers always run on the MSP, whatever the thread uses.
//
// app_stack_run() paints the stack, arms PSPLIM above a 32-byte guard at the
// bottom (a push past it is a STKOF HardFault instead of silent corruption),
// switches Thread mode to the PSP, calls fn(arg), and switches back. The
// HardFault handler reads g_app_stack_base/owner to name the stack.
//
// Simulator: there is no PSP; fn(arg) runs directly on the host stack.
