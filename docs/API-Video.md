title: "API — Video Playback"
---

PicOS supports MJPEG video playback from AVI files stored on the SD card. Video is decoded on Core 0 using JPEGDEC and displayed via the standard display framebuffer. Audio tracks (MP3) are decoded on Core 1 via a shared ring buffer.

---

## Requirements

Add `"video"` (no explicit requirement needed) or `"audio"` to your `app.json` if your video has an audio track:

```json
{
  "requirements": ["audio"]
}
```

## Lua API

### Creating a player

```lua
local player = picocalc.video.player()
```

#### `picocalc.video.player()`
Creates a new video player instance.

- **Returns:** (userdata) Video player object, or `nil, errstr` on failure

### Loading and playing

```lua
player:load("/apps/myvideo/clip.avi")  -- path on SD card
player:play()
player:stop()
-- no destroy(): the player is freed automatically by Lua garbage collection
```

### Playback control

```lua
player:setLoop(true)         -- loop continuously (default: false — hold the last frame)
player:seek(frame_number)    -- jump to a specific frame index
player:seekMs(ms)            -- jump to an absolute time
player:seekRelativeMs(-5000) -- skip backwards/forwards relative to the current position
```

All seeks clamp to `[0, last frame]` and **never wrap**: seeking to or past the last frame ends the video on the next `update()` (held, or looped if `setLoop(true)`). A seek while paused decodes and presents the target frame immediately, so scrubbing gives feedback. A seek on an ended player restarts playback from the target.

#### `player:pause()`
Pauses video playback. Audio is also paused. The current frame is presented as a stable still (with the OSD) so the app can draw overlays and call `display.flush()` freely.

#### `player:resume()`
Resumes video playback after a pause. On an ended player this replays from the start (same as `play()`).

#### End of video
With looping off, reaching the last frame holds it on screen: `isPlaying()` becomes `false`, `hasEnded()` becomes `true`, and the OSD shows the bar at 100% with `END`. Call `play()` (or `resume()`) to replay, or seek to continue from elsewhere.

---

### Position and duration

```lua
player:getFrameCount()   -- total frames
player:getDurationMs()   -- total length in milliseconds
player:getPositionMs()   -- position of the frame on screen, in milliseconds
player:hasEnded()        -- true once the last frame was reached (loop off)
```

---

### Progress OSD

The player draws its own on-screen display over the bottom of the video area: a progress bar with a playhead, elapsed time on the left, total time on the right, and a pause glyph or `END` marker in the middle. It is enabled by default.

```lua
player:setOSD(true)          -- enable/disable (default: enabled)
player:showOSD()             -- show now and restart the hide timer
player:setOSDTimeout(3000)   -- ms to stay visible while playing (default 3000)
```

The OSD appears automatically on `play()`, `pause()`, `resume()` and every seek. While playing it hides after the timeout; while paused or ended it stays. It is drawn into the decoded frame before the frame is flushed, so it costs nothing extra to present and works with both `setAutoFlush(true)` and manual flushing. Videos shorter than 48 px tall skip the OSD.

---

### Performance and stats

#### `player:getFPS()`
Returns the actual playback frame rate.

- **Returns:** (number) Frames per second

```lua
local fps = player:getFPS()
picocalc.sys.log("FPS: " .. string.format("%.1f", fps))
```

#### `player:getSize()`
Returns the video frame dimensions.

- **Returns:** (number, number) Width and height in pixels

```lua
local w, h = player:getSize()
```

#### `player:getDroppedFrames()`
Returns the number of frames dropped during playback due to decode not keeping up with the frame rate.

- **Returns:** (number) Number of dropped frames

#### `player:resetStats()`
Resets playback statistics (dropped frame counter).

#### `player:setAutoFlush(enabled)`
Controls whether the player automatically calls `display.flush()` after each decoded frame. When disabled, the app must call `display.flush()` manually, allowing HUD overlays to be drawn between decode and flush.

- **Parameters:**
  - `enabled` (boolean): `true` for automatic flush (default), `false` for manual flush

```lua
player:setAutoFlush(false)  -- manual flush for HUD overlay
```

---

### Audio control

```lua
player:hasAudio()            -- true if the AVI file contains an MP3 audio track
player:setMuted(true)        -- mute audio (video still plays)
player:isMuted()             -- returns current mute state
player:setVolume(vol)        -- 0–100
player:getVolume()           -- returns current volume
```

### State

```lua
player:isPlaying()           -- true while playing
player:isPaused()            -- true while paused
local info = player:getInfo()
-- info.width, info.height   — frame dimensions
-- info.frames               — total frames in file
-- info.current_frame        — current playback position
-- info.dropped_frames       — frames dropped during playback
-- info.has_audio            — whether an audio track was found
-- info.duration_ms          — total length in milliseconds
-- info.position_ms          — position of the frame on screen
-- info.ended                — true once the last frame was reached (loop off)
-- info.fps                  — content frame rate
```

### Game loop integration

Call `player:update()` each frame to advance playback:

```lua
local player = picocalc.video.player()
player:load("/apps/demo/video.avi")
player:play()

while true do
    player:update()
    -- draw HUD or overlays here
    picocalc.display.flush()

    picocalc.input.update()
    local pressed = picocalc.input.getButtonsPressed()
    if pressed & picocalc.input.BTN_ESC ~= 0 then break end
end

player:stop()
```

## Video format

PicOS plays **MJPEG AVI** files only. Each video frame is an independent JPEG; the player does not support inter-frame codecs (H.264, VP9, etc.).

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Container | AVI (RIFF) |
| Video codec | MJPEG (Motion JPEG) |
| Audio codec | MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer III) |
| Resolution | Up to 320 × 320 (native display size) |
| Frame rate | 25 fps recommended |
| Audio sample rate | 22050 Hz or 44100 Hz |
| Audio channels | Mono or stereo |

---

## Converting video with `video_converter.sh`

The `tools/video_converter.sh` script converts any video file (or YouTube URL) to the correct AVI format using `ffmpeg`.

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install ffmpeg (required)
sudo apt install ffmpeg          # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install ffmpeg              # macOS
sudo dnf install ffmpeg          # Fedora

# Install yt-dlp (only needed for URL downloads)
pip install yt-dlp
```

### Usage

```bash
tools/video_converter.sh [options] <file_or_url>
```

Output is written to `~/Videos/PicOS/` (the directory must exist).

### Options

| Flag | Description | Default |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `--crop` | Scale to 320×320, cropping to fill (square crop) | off (letterbox) |
| `--quality N` | MJPEG quality, 1 (best) – 31 (worst) | `8` |
| `--mute` | Strip the audio track entirely | off (include audio) |
| `--chroma444` | Keep full-resolution colour (`yuvj444p`); roughly doubles decode time | off (`yuvj420p`) |

### Examples

```bash
# Basic conversion — letterbox to 320×height, include audio
tools/video_converter.sh myclip.mp4

# Square crop for portrait/square content
tools/video_converter.sh --crop myclip.mp4

# High quality, muted (video-only)
tools/video_converter.sh --quality 3 --mute myclip.mp4

# Download and convert directly from YouTube
tools/video_converter.sh "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Download, crop, strip audio
tools/video_converter.sh --crop --mute "https://youtu.be/..."
```

### What the converter does

**Without `--crop`** (letterbox):
```
ffmpeg -i <input>
  -vf "fps=25,scale=320:-1"
  -vcodec mjpeg -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v <quality> -huffman optimal
  -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k -ar 22050
  <output>.avi
```

**With `--crop`** (square fill):
```
ffmpeg -i <input>
  -vf "fps=25,scale=320:320:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=320:320"
  -vcodec mjpeg -pix_fmt yuvj420p -q:v <quality> -huffman optimal
  -acodec libmp3lame -ab 128k -ar 22050
  <output>.avi
```

**With `--mute`**: replaces the `-acodec libmp3lame ...` line with `-an` (no audio).

**Chroma subsampling**: 4:2:0 (`yuvj420p`) is forced because it halves the decoder's chroma work on the RP2350 and is visually indistinguishable on the 320×320 panel for real footage. ffmpeg only picks it by itself when the source is already 4:2:0, so 4:4:4 or RGB sources would otherwise decode about twice as slowly. `--chroma444` keeps full-resolution colour for the rare clip that needs it.

---

## Audio implementation notes

Audio is decoded using the **MP3 fed mode** in `mp3_player.c`. Rather than reading from an SD file directly, Core 0 (video player) pre-indexes audio chunks from the AVI file and feeds compressed MP3 data into a 64 KB ring buffer in QMI PSRAM. Core 1 reads from this ring and decodes in the normal MP3 DMA path. This avoids PIO PSRAM bus contention (PIO1 SPI is not safe across cores) and lets video and audio share the existing MP3 playback pipeline.

Audio playback is automatically stopped and the ring freed when `player:stop()` is called or the player is garbage-collected.

---

## Clock speed during playback

When `player:play()` is called, the system clock is raised from 200 MHz to **300 MHz** to fit MJPEG decode within the 40 ms frame budget. The clock is restored when `player:stop()` is called.

Because the CYW43 WiFi PIO divider cannot be updated at runtime, **WiFi is disconnected** before the overclock and reconnected (using saved credentials) after restore. Apps that require persistent WiFi connections should avoid video playback, or mute the audio and skip the overclock by using a custom playback loop.
