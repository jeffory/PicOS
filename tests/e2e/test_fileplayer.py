"""WAV fileplayer flow control and per-player files (review: Audio/storage
Critical row 1 "The WAV fileplayer f_reads 4 KB ... a long WAV ends in
seconds", High row "Cross-core use-after-free ... One s_current_file is
shared by all fileplayer instances"; Task 14).

The simulator runs the firmware src/drivers/fileplayer.c and drains the
stream ring (audio_ring.h) at the real 44.1 kHz output rate, so wall-clock
play time is a faithful check of the producer's flow control: a fileplayer
that reads faster than the ring drains drops audio and finishes early.
Each case runs alone in its own simulator.
