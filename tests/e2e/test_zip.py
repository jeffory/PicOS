"""E2E tests for the hardened ZIP engine (zip_util) and archive handles.

The old zip path had NO traversal guard on the native side and a substring
".." check on the Lua side; the engine now validates entry names component-
wise and enforces entry-count / size caps. These tests feed it deliberately
hostile archives (crafted with python's zipfile below) and assert both the
Lua-visible behaviour (via "ZE " marker logs from the zip_test fixture app)
and the filesystem outcome (nothing escapes the destination).
