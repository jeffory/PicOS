"""Native app exit gives back everything the app took through the API.

specs/code-review-2026-09-24.md, Core Medium "Native app exit only cleans up
audio and menu items...": files, images, players, terminals and PSRAM a
native app never freed stayed allocated (and FatFS's 16 open-file slots
stayed taken) until a reboot.

tests/e2e/apps/native_leaky (source tests/e2e/native/leaky.c) opens 12
files, makes 8 160x160 images, leaves a sample player playing, plus a
sampleless player, a file player, a terminal, a MOD player and a qmiAlloc
block, then returns. tests/e2e/apps/mem_report (Lua) logs the PSRAM heap and
how many of 16 simultaneous opens succeed; it runs before and after.

--real-umm: the firmware's umm_malloc on a device-sized arena, so
psram_largest_block means what it means on hardware.
